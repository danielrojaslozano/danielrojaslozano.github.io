I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://politics.ubc.ca/graduate/). In Spring 2024, I was a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Government at [Dartmouth College](https://govt.dartmouth.edu/). My research interests lie in comparative politics and the political economy of development. I use observational and experimental empirical strategies to study inequality, redistribution, and immigration, primarily in Latin America. Some of the questions I address in my work include: How do business elites respond to social unrest? Under what conditions do wealthy individuals support redistribution? What limits migrantsâ€™ socioeconomic integration in host societies? What interventions can reduce the spread of online misinformation among migrants?
