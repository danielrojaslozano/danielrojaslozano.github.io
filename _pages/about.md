I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Political Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://politics.ubc.ca/graduate/). I study the political economy of developing democracies, with a regional focus on Latin America. My research interests include inequality, preferences for redistribution, and migration. 

In my dissertation, I investigate why economic elites fear prospective left-wing governments and how they respond to growing support for left-wing candidates.
