I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Political Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://politics.ubc.ca/graduate/). I study the political economy of redistribution and redistributive preferences in economic elites. Specifically, I research under what conditions the wealthy in developing democracies are more likely to support redistributive policies. I use quantitative methods to answer my research questions.

When I'm not doing research, I'm cooking.
