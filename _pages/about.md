I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://politics.ubc.ca/graduate/). My research interests are in comparative politics and the political economy of development. My work focuses on developing democracies, particularly in Latin America.

I use observational and experimental empirical strategies to investigate when and why elites respond to redistributive demands expressed through electoral and non-electoral means.

In another line of research, I study migrants’ digital vulnerabilities and investigate interventions to reduce migrants’ exposure to misinformation. 

<!-- I am an affiliated researcher at the [Centro Latam Digital](https://centrolatam.digital/).-->
