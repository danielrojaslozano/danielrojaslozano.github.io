I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Political Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://politics.ubc.ca/graduate/). I study the political economy of developing democracies, with a regional focus on Latin America. My research interests include social policy, preferences for redistribution, and migration. In my dissertation, I investigate how and when political and economic elites respond to growing support for left-wing parties. 

I am an affiliated researcher at the [Centro Latam Digital](https://centrolatam.digital/).
