I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://politics.ubc.ca/graduate/). In Spring 2024, I was a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Government at [Dartmouth College](https://govt.dartmouth.edu/). My research interests are in comparative politics and the political economy of development. My work focuses on developing democracies, particularly in Latin America. 

I use observational and experimental empirical strategies to investigate economic elites’ responses to electoral and extra-electoral redistributive demands. In another line of research, I study migration in Latin America. Some of the topics I investigate include migrants’ second-order beliefs, interventions to reduce migrants’ digital vulnerabilities, and the salience of migration in host communities.
