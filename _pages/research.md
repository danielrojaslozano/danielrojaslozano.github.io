Do Governments Reward Left-Wing Opponents?
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> Do governments reward left-wing opposition voters? The literature on distributive politics finds that governments use transfers to reward supporters. Yet this work focuses on what incumbents do before elections, fails to find compensations after elections, and overlooks who the incumbent won to even when different contenders might imply different risks to the establishment. I argue that governments strategically allocate transfers to reward left-wing opposition constituencies after elections and prevent future support for the Left given its historical threat to elites. Using a continuous difference-in-difference research design with data from Colombia, I show that opposition constituencies receive more transfers after elections but not before. A cross-national analysis further supports my argument. These findings have implications for the politics of the red scare in developing democracies.</p>

When Pandemic Threat Does Not Stoke Xenophobia: Evidence from a Panel Survey around COVID-19 in Colombia. (with [Yang-Yang Zhou](https://www.yangyangzhou.com/) and [Margaret Peters](http://www.maggiepeters.com/)) 
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected attitudes of host citizens towards refugees and migrants? A large literature, mostly in Global North contexts, links disease threat with increased xenophobia. Indeed, recent studies on the effects of COVID-19 have found an increase in hate crimes and anti-migrant attitudes, particularly when political elites exclude and blame migrants for the pandemic. We examine the case of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, in which elite rhetoric and immigration policies have been largely inclusive. Using a panel experimental survey of 374 Colombian respondents, supplemented by 550 new respondents at endline, we find no evidence that exposure to COVID-19 changes Colombians' attitudes towards Venezuelans, even if the respondents were directly affected by COVID. In fact, we find some evidence of empathy. Our research implies that xenophobia in reaction to pandemics is not a foregone conclusion, but likely a product of political scapegoating.</p>
