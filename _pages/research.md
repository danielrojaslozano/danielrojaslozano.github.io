**Do Governments Reward Left-Wing Opponents?** (under review)
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> Do governments reward left-wing opposition voters? The literature on distributive politics finds that governments use transfers to reward supporters. Yet this work focuses on what incumbents do before elections, fails to find compensations after elections, and overlooks who the incumbent won to even when different contenders might imply different risks to the establishment. I argue that governments strategically allocate transfers to reward left-wing opposition constituencies after elections and prevent future support for the Left given its historical threat to elites. Using a continuous difference-in-difference research design with data from Colombia, I show that opposition constituencies receive more transfers after elections but not before. A cross-national analysis further supports my argument. These findings have implications for the politics of the red scare in developing democracies.</p>

 **Government Ideology and Support for Redistribution Among the Wealthy: Survey Experimental Evidence** with Fabio Resmini
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> When do wealthy individuals support redistributive policies? Recent literature finds that high levels of inequality and crime increase support for redistribution among the rich. However, the wealthy oppose redistribution in Latin America, a region with high inequality and criminality. We argue that the rich are sensitive to the negative externalities of inequality, but their support for redistribution depends on who advances the redistributive agenda: the Left or the Right. We posit the rich prefer redistribution under the Right because there is less uncertainty about the upper bound of the redistributive policy, more expected effectiveness, and fewer concerns about macroeconomic stability. Pre-registered survey experiments during the 2022 Colombian presidential election show that wealthy individuals support tax increases when proposed by the right-wing candidate and expect more effectiveness and less economic instability with a prospective right-wing government. Heterogeneous effects analyses further confirm that support for redistribution depends on who makes it.</p>

**When Pandemic Threat Does Not Stoke Xenophobia: Evidence from a Panel Survey around COVID-19** with Yang-Yang Zhou and Margaret Peters
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> Many studies have found that pandemics heighten anti-immigrant attitudes among host citizens. Yet, most of these studies were done in Global North countries where migrants are likely to differ from host citizens in terms of race, religion, and ethnicity. Within the Global South, migrants and hosts are more likely to share these characteristics. Do pandemics spark the same anti-immigrant sentiment in these contexts? Further, pandemics often bring economic restrictions and job loss, making it difficult to untangle concerns over disease from economic concerns.  We examine the case of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, who share many characteristics with host citizens, before and during COVID-19. Additionally, the Colombian government implemented a strict lockdown for several months, allowing us to focus on the economic effects of the pandemic. Using a panel experimental survey of 374 Colombians, supplemented by 550 new respondents at endline, we find no evidence that exposure to COVID-19 changes attitudes, even if respondents were directly affected. However, those who did not lose their jobs viewed Venezuelan migration more positively at endline.</p>
