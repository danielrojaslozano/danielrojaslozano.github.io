Policy Responsiveness in Developing Democracies: Evidence from Latin America. 
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> The literature on government responsiveness to public preferences has tended to treat responsiveness as a unitary phenomenon, asking whether or to what degree governments respond. In this paper, I argue that government responsiveness is likely to be unevenly distributed geographically. First, government responsiveness is absent in places controlled by non-state actors. Second, responsiveness decreases with voters' abstention. I provide empirical support for my arguments using administrative data from over 1,000 municipalities and more than four million administrative records of a CCT program in Colombia. I also examine responsiveness at the country level. I show that, in Latin American countries where the electorate is at the left side of the government's ideological position, governments redistribute more. My findings on unequal responsiveness have implications for subnational socioeconomic inequalities.</p>

When Pandemic Threat Does Not Stoke Xenophobia: Evidence from a Panel Survey around COVID-19 in Colombia. (with [Yang-Yang Zhou](https://www.yangyangzhou.com/) and [Margaret Peters](http://www.maggiepeters.com/)) (*Under review*)
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected attitudes of host citizens towards refugees and migrants? A large literature, mostly in Global North contexts, links disease threat with increased xenophobia. Indeed, recent studies on the effects of COVID-19 have found an increase in hate crimes and anti-migrant attitudes, particularly when political elites exclude and blame migrants for the pandemic. We examine the case of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, in which elite rhetoric and immigration policies have been largely inclusive. Using a panel experimental survey of 374 Colombian respondents, supplemented by 550 new respondents at endline, we find no evidence that exposure to COVID-19 changes Colombians' attitudes towards Venezuelans, even if the respondents were directly affected by COVID. In fact, we find some evidence of empathy. Our research implies that xenophobia in reaction to pandemics is not a foregone conclusion, but likely a product of political scapegoating.</p>
