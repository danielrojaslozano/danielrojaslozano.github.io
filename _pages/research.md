**Do Governments Reward Left-Wing Opponents?** (under review)
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> Do governments reward left-wing opposition voters? The literature on distributive politics finds that governments use transfers to reward supporters. Yet this work focuses on what incumbents do before elections, fails to find compensations after elections, and overlooks who the incumbent won to even when different contenders might imply different risks to the establishment. I argue that governments strategically allocate transfers to reward left-wing opposition constituencies after elections and prevent future support for the Left given its historical threat to elites. Using a continuous difference-in-difference research design with data from Colombia, I show that opposition constituencies receive more transfers after elections but not before. A cross-national analysis further supports my argument. These findings have implications for the politics of the red scare in developing democracies.</p>

 **Ideological Expectations and Support for Redistribution among the Wealthy** (with Fabio Resmini)
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> When and why do wealthy individuals support redistributive policies? Under standard political economy models, preferences for redistribution are a function of objective material conditions. Yet, we argue that the wealthy are more likely to support redistribution when proposed by the Right rather than the Left because they perceive redistribution under the former as less uncertain, more efficient, and less prone to create macroeconomic instability. Survey experiments during the 2022 Colombian presidential election support our argument. We find that the wealthy are more likely to support redistribution under a right-wing government and expect redistribution under the Right to be more efficient and less likely to generate instability. We demonstrate that the ideological composition of our sample does not drive our results and find heterogeneous preferences across respondentsâ€™ ideological positions. Importantly, the Right diminishes expectations of macroeconomic instability in both right- and left-wing wealthy. These findings illustrate the micro-foundations of right-wing redistribution.

**When Pandemic Threat Does Not Stoke Xenophobia: Evidence from a Panel Survey around COVID-19** (with Yang-Yang Zhou and Margaret Peters) (under review)
<br />
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> Many studies have found that pandemics heighten anti-immigrant attitudes among host citizens. Yet, most of these studies were done in Global North countries where migrants are likely to differ from host citizens in terms of race, religion, and ethnicity. Within the Global South, migrants and hosts are more likely to share these characteristics. Do pandemics spark the same anti-immigrant sentiment in these contexts? Further, pandemics often bring economic restrictions and job loss, making it difficult to untangle concerns over disease from economic concerns.  We examine the case of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, who share many characteristics with host citizens, before and during COVID-19. Additionally, the Colombian government implemented a strict lockdown for several months, allowing us to focus on the economic effects of the pandemic. Using a panel experimental survey of 374 Colombians, supplemented by 550 new respondents at endline, we find no evidence that exposure to COVID-19 changes attitudes, even if respondents were directly affected. However, those who did not lose their jobs viewed Venezuelan migration more positively at endline.</p>
